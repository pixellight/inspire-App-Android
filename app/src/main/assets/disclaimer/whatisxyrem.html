<p style="margin-left:0px;margin-top:15px;">XYREM is a prescription medicine taken by mouth at night
    to help relieve 2 daytime symptoms of
    narcolepsy: excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and cataplexy (sudden weakening of muscles
    triggered
    by strong emotions). XYREM is the <strong><em>only</em></strong> available FDA-approved
    treatment for both cataplexy and EDS in
    narcolepsy in both children and adults, and the only FDA-approved treatment for cataplexy. XYREM
    may
    only be given to patients enrolled in the XYREM REMS Program.</p>
<h4>Important Safety Information</h4>
<div class="warning">

    <p>WARNING: Taking XYREM with other CNS depressants such as medicines used to make
        you or your child fall asleep, including opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, sedating
        antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedating anti-epileptic medicines, general anesthetics,
        muscle relaxants, alcohol, or street drugs, may cause serious medical problems, including
        trouble breathing (respiratory depression), low blood pressure (hypotension), changes in
        alertness (drowsiness), dizziness (syncope), and death.</p>
    <p>XYREM is a form of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Abuse or misuse of illegal GHB alone
        or with other drugs that cause changes in alertness (or consciousness) has caused
        serious side effects. These effects include seizures, trouble breathing (respiratory
        depression), changes in alertness (drowsiness), coma, and death. Call your doctor right
        away if you or your child has any of these serious side effects.</p>
    <p>Because of these risks, you have to go through the XYREM REMS Program to have your
        or your child’s prescription for XYREM filled.</p>
    <!--<p>Because of these risks, you have to go through the XYREM REMS Program to have your prescription for XYREM filled. The XYREM REMS Program uses the central Certified Pharmacy. For further information, go to www.XYREMREMS.com or call 1-866-XYREM88® (1-866-997-3688). Both patients and their doctors have to join this Program.</p>-->

    <p>
        &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:16px;"><strong>Do not take XYREM if you take or your
        child takes</strong> other sleep medicines or sedatives (medicines that
        cause sleepiness), drink alcohol, or have a rare problem called succinic semialdehyde
        dehydrogenase
        deficiency..</p>

    <p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:16px;">Keep XYREM in a safe place to prevent abuse and
        misuse. Selling or giving away XYREM may
        harm others, and is against the law. Tell your doctor if you have ever abused or been
        dependent
        on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs.</p>

    <p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:16px;">Anyone who takes XYREM should not do anything that
        requires them to be fully awake or is
        dangerous, including driving a car, using heavy machinery, or flying an airplane, for at
        least 6
        hours after taking XYREM. Those activities should not be done until you know how XYREM
        affects
        you or your child.</p>


    <p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:16px;">
        <span><strong>XYREM can cause serious side effects, including the following:</strong></span>

    <ul>

        <li style="margin-bottom:4px;margin-right:4px;"><strong>Breathing problems,
            including</strong> slower

            breathing, trouble breathing, and/or short periods of not breathing

            while sleeping (sleep apnea). People who already have breathing or lung

            problems have a higher chance of having breathing problems when they use

            XYREM.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-bottom:4px;margin-right:4px;"><strong>Mental health problems,
            including</strong> confusion, seeing or hearing things that are not real
            (hallucinations), unusual or disturbing thoughts (abnormal thinking), feeling anxious or
            upset, depression, or thoughts of killing yourself or trying to kill yourself. Tell your
            doctor
            if you or your child have or had depression or have tried to harm yourself or
            themselves. <strong>Call your doctor right away if you have or your child has symptoms
                of mental health
                problems.</strong></li>

        <li style="margin-bottom:4px;margin-right:4px;"><strong>Sleepwalking.</strong> Sleepwalking
            can cause injuries. Call your doctor if you or your child
            starts sleepwalking. Your doctor should check you or your child.
        </li>

    </ul>

    </p>

    <p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:16px;">Tell your doctor if you are or your child is on a salt-restricted diet or if you have or your child has
        high blood pressure, heart failure, or kidney problems. XYREM contains a lot of sodium (salt) and
        may not be right for you or your child.</p>


    <p style="margin-left:0px;margin-right:16px;">The most common side effects of
        <strong>XYREM</strong> include nausea, sleepiness, dizziness, vomiting,
        bedwetting, and tremor (in adults). In pediatric patients, headache, decreased appetite, and
        weight
        decrease were also common. Your side effects may increase when you take higher doses of
        <strong>XYREM</strong>.
        XYREM can cause physical dependence and craving for the medicine when it is not taken as
        directed. These are not all the possible side effects of <strong>XYREM</strong>.</p>
