<p class="header"><strong><u>EDS Severity</u></strong></p>
<p>Everyone with narcolepsy experiences EDS. This means you have an overwhelming urge to sleep
    without warning, anywhere, anytime. It is most likely to happen in situations that don't require
    active participation, such as when you are watching TV or reading a book. But it can also happen
    when it is important to be alert, such as during conversations, eating, walking, or at work. You
    may nap several times a day, but only feel refreshed for a short time. This is one way that EDS
    is different from just feeling generally tired.</p>
