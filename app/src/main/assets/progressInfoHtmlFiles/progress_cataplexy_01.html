<p class="header"><strong><u>Cataplexy Frequency</u></strong></p>
  <p>About 70% of people living with narcolepsy experience cataplexy, which is when your muscles suddenly go weak or become paralyzed, usually for a short time. This can happen when you experience a strong emotion, which as laughing, joking, and anger. Cataplexy attacks can be fairly mild&mdash;such as a sagging jaw or dropping eye or head, slurred speech, weakness in the arm or shoulder, or buckling knees. In more severe cases, people are not able to remain standing, and will fall or sink to the ground. But even though they cannot move, they are awake and aware of their surroundings. Cataplexy attacks may last from a few seconds to a few minutes.</p>
